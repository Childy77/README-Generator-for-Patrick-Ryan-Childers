README GENERATOR FOR PATRICK RYAN CHILDERS

-I started by adding the needed packages for the application

-I added package.json

-I added the node modules

-I created the questions for the README in index.js

-I wrote the functions to write the README file and initialize the app

-I used Jquery to generate the questions and show the license badges

-With the help of a tutor, I was able to clean up my files to make them more accessible for the user
